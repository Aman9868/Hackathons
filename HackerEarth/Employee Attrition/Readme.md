# Problem statement

Employees certainly are the most important asset of an organization. They are the ones working behind the scenes to ensure that your business functions seamlessly like a well-oiled machine. Hiring the best fit for an organization and ensuring that they stick with the company are two sides of the same coin. Employee attrition not only may lead to a minor hitch in the system, but it is also a major cost to the organization.

The Human Resources department of your organization is determined to predict the employee attrition rate in advance and put a corrective plan of action in place. As a Machine Learning Specialist, the HR team has requested you to build a sophisticated model that predicts the organization’s attrition rate.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of various details such as gender and age of the employee, education and relationship status, pay scale, and other factors that may influence the attrition rate.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning techniques are as follows:

This challenge will encourage you to apply your Machine Learning skills to build models that can predict employee attrition rates.
This challenge will help you enhance your knowledge of regression. Regression is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning.
We challenge you to build a model that computes the attrition rate for an employee working in an organization.

# Prizes
Considering these unfortunate times that the entire world is facing due to the Coronavirus pandemic, we wish to do our bit and contribute the prize money for the welfare of society.

# Overview

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experiences without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning is a Science that determines patterns in data. These patterns provide a deeper meaning to problems. First, it helps you understand the problems better and then solve the same with elegance.

Here is the new HackerEarth Machine Learning Challenge—Will your employees leave you?

This challenge is designed to help you improve your Machine Learning skills by competing and learning from fellow participants.

# Why should you participate?

To analyze and implement multiple algorithms and determine which is more appropriate for a problem
To get hands-on experience in Machine Learning problems
Who should participate?

# Guidelines

1.Your output will be evaluated only for 30% of the test data while the contest is running. Once the contest is over, output for the remaining 100% of the data will be evaluated and the final rank will be awarded.

2.You will have to upload your output on the problem page in the format given in the problem statement. In addition to your output, you will also have to submit your source and other files in .zip or .tar compressed archive.

3.The total number of submissions allowed by a participant is 2000. The maximum number of submissions a participant can make in a day is 100.

4.You can use any tools or libraries for building your solution. There is no restriction on the tools that you can use.

5.You can only participate as an individual.

6.The IP of the product/code of the winners will belong to HackerEarth if they choose to accept the prize. Other participants will retain complete IP over their code/product and they may wish to put it in open source domain under any license they want to.

7.By participating in this Machine Learning, you agree to the terms and conditions of HackerEarth.
